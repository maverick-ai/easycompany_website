              By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically
              apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them
              carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or
              modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way.
              You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the
              app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other
              languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all
              the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual
              property rights related to it, still belong to easycompany.
              easycompany is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and
              efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to
              make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time
              and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its
              services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re
              paying for. The easycompany app stores and processes personal data
              that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service.
              It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app
              secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root
              your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions
              and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your
              device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
              malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
              security features and it could mean that the easycompany app won’t
              work properly or at all. The app does use third party services
              that declare their own Terms and Conditions. Link to Terms and
              Conditions of third party service providers used by the app Google
              Play Services Facebook You should be aware that there are certain
              things that easycompany will not take responsibility for. Certain
              functions of the app will require the app to have an active
              internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by
              your mobile network provider, but easycompany cannot take
              responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if
              you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your
              data allowance left. If you’re using the app outside of an area
              with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement
              with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result,
              you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data
              for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
              other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
              responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
              charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
              region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are
              not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app,
              please be aware that we assume that you have received permission
              from the bill payer for using the app. Along the same lines,
              easycompany cannot always take responsibility for the way you use
              the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged
              – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
              Service, easycompany cannot accept responsibility. With respect to
              easycompany’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re
              using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we
              endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times,
              we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that
              we can make it available to you. easycompany accepts no liability
              for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
              relying wholly on this functionality of the app. At some point, we
              may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on
              Android & iOS – the requirements for both systems(and for any
              additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app
              to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you
              want to keep using the app. easycompany does not promise that it
              will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or
              works with the Android & iOS version that you have installed on
              your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the
              application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop
              providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without
              giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise,
              upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you
              in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if
              needed) delete it from your device. Changes to This Terms and
              Conditions We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to
              time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for
              any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
              Terms and Conditions on this page. These terms and conditions are
              effective as of 2021-10-23 Contact Us If you have any questions or
